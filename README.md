# RequestMake
is a tool for making requests to REST APIs. It's like postman, obviously it doesn't have as many tools as this one, but it's much faster. I did it to be able to make quick and simple requests and I will update it adapting it to my nonsense. If you want me to export it to a certain OS, tell me. If not you can do it yourself with Godot engine
